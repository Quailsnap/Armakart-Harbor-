	<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>If you've ever played Mariokart, you'll know how to play Armakart.
	<br/>
	<br/>I'm not going to go into every single mechanic that has been implemented, everything should be perfectly self explanatory.
	<br/>
	<br/>Check the Hotkeys and Navigation briefing tab to understand how to use important game functions!
	<br/>
	<br/><font color='#12aa70' size='18' face='TahomaB'>Note: All players must follow gameplay rules and concepts defined in the briefing tab, failure to follow these rules can lead to you ruining the race for everyone else.</font>

	<br/><font color='#FF8000' size='20' face='PuristaBold'>Boost Pads/Powerup Blocks</font>
	<br/> - Boost Pads and Powerup Blocks are littered throughout the track and are designed to help give players a edge ahead of their opponents
	<br/>
	<br/><font color='#FF8000' size='20' face='PuristaBold'>Powerups</font>
	<br/> - Powerups can be anything from a VERY explosive washing machine to a banana gun, they can help you, but they can also be detrimental if used incorrectly
	<br/>
	<br/><font color='#FF8000' size='20' face='PuristaBold'>In Race UI</font>
	<br/> - The in race UI will give you an accurate display of your current lap and checkpoint.
	<br/>
	<br/> - Passengers in doubles teams WILL NOT be able to se their place, it tis up to the driver to relay that info.
	<br/>
	<br/> - Note: The in race UIs' position display will be come inaccurate if you take a shortcut or unintended map skip, it will reset to proper positioning once you go through your next checkpoint or the finish line.

	<br/> - You MUST stay as the role you picked, do not under any circumstance change this during the race.
	<br/>
	<br/> - Do not leave or join someones group, you WILL fuck up some scripts and it will not be pretty.
	<br/>
	<br/><font color='#4da6ff' size='20' face='PuristaBold'>Checkpoints</font>
	<br/> - Please do not place mines or bananas around checkpoints, it's a dick move, and you should feel ashamed of yourself if you do.
